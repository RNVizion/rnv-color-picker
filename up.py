For rnv-color-picker, derived against a fresh clone at the live head (4c4ca1a).

RNV-DELIVERY-SCRIPT-DO-NOT-SWEEP. This script is a delivery tool, not
application source, and it names what it retires. That marker is what tells
this fleet's scanners to skip it.

RULED 2026-09-26, decision 5 of the colour chart: "Removed if not used;
render first so we can make sure they are not used."

APP_CANVAS_OVERLAY -- APP_CANVAS at IMAGE_OVERLAY_ALPHA -- was image mode's
image_viewer_bg, and in image mode the viewer paints OVERLAY_BLACK_MEDIUM and
never reads that key. Rendered first (probes/unused_render.py): set to
#ff00ff it changed no pixel in 171 captures and no text in 1,635 sheet and
palette entries; a control that moved dark's image_viewer_bg changed 11
captures and 12 entries. The constant goes, with its provenance entry and the
override, and the guards that held it are updated.
