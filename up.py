For rnv-color-picker, derived against a fresh clone at the live head (ea423fa).

RNV-DELIVERY-SCRIPT-DO-NOT-SWEEP. This script is a delivery tool, not
application source, and it names what it retires. That marker is what tells
this fleet's scanners to skip it.

RULED 2026-09-25 (ruling 3): colours written as integer tuples are derived,
the NAMED ones only; the structural QColor(0, 0, 0) and QColor(255, 255, 255)
calls are left alone. OVERLAY_BLACK_LIGHT, _MEDIUM and _HEAVY were (0, 0, 0, 50), (0, 0, 0, 75)
and (0, 0, 0, 180). They are translucent_tuple(TRUE_BLACK, <named alpha>) now,
the same tuples, and the locked suite's pins on their values still hold.
Nothing moves on screen.
