"""The README says how many tests there are in a way that stays true.

RNV-RULINGS-2026-10-05, item 18. Ruled 2026-10-05: "Do B".

WHAT WAS THERE. Exact totals, written once and kept in step by nothing. On
2026-10-05 the README said 1,641 tests and pytest collected 1,949.

WHAT IS THERE NOW. Every figure is a floor: "over N". N is the number of
test functions the suites define, rounded down to the hundred. A test added
leaves it true, so there is nothing to keep in step. pytest collects more
than that number, because a parametrised function is written once and
collected once for each case.

WHAT THIS GUARD HOLDS.

1. Every number of tests the README states is a floor. An exact count,
   written as a sentence, as a badge or as a cell of the suites' table, is
   how the old ones went stale.
2. Every floor is true. The suite it speaks of defines more test functions
   than it says. Take tests away until one is not, and this names it: lower
   the README's number.
3. The reader is looking. It finds the README's floors, and it tells an
   exact count from a floor in each of the three ways one is written.

WHAT IT DOES NOT HOLD. The coverage figures beside the counts: a coverage
figure depends on the platform it was taken on.
